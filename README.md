2. Audit Categories & Response Tags
Each audit should return a structured JSON response with the following tags:

Category	Tag Name	Value Format	Notes
Professionalism	professionalism_score	Integer (1–10)	Judged by attire, posture, clarity
Approachability	approachability_score	Integer (1–10)	Smile, eye contact, openness
Background Quality	background_feedback	String enum	e.g. ["clean", "distracting", "virtual", "blurred"]
Lighting	lighting_feedback	String	e.g. "well-lit", "shadowed"
Image Quality	image_quality_score	Integer (1–10)	Blurriness, resolution, cropping
Framing & Composition	framing_feedback	String	e.g. "centered", "off-angle"
Consistency	platform_fit_score	Integer (1–10)	Fit for platform (e.g. LinkedIn vs IG)
Facial Expression	expression_feedback	String	e.g. "neutral", "warm smile", "stern"
Accessories & Attire	attire_feedback	String	e.g. "formal", "casual", "inappropriate"

3. Response Output Format

  "image_quality_score": 9,
  "framing_feedback": "centered",
  "platform_fit_score": 8,
  "expression_feedback": "warm smile",
  "attire_feedback": "business casual",
  "summary": "You look confident and approachable! Just make sure the lighting is more even next time."
}
4. Audit Rules (Scoring Logic)
Use a rule-based or ML model-backed heuristic to assign tag values:

Use facial expression recognition models (e.g. OpenCV/DeepFace).

Use CLIP or ViT embeddings for background and composition evaluation.

Use Hugging Face fine-tuned image classification model for attire category.

Normalize score to platform standards:

LinkedIn: Heavier weight on professionalism and attire.

Instagram: Weight toward aesthetics, expression, and creativity.

5. Optional Enhancements
Predefined style tags:

e.g. ["corporate", "influencer", "artsy", "academic"]

Suggestions:

"Consider cropping tighter to reduce headroom."

Use Hugging Face’s zero-shot-classification for style prediction.

6. Ethical Guidelines
No biases based on race, gender, facial features.

Don’t auto-score attractiveness.

Be inclusive and focus on professional improvement, not critique.
